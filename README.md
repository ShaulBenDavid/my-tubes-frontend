# My-Tubes

My-Tubes is a tool that helps you manage the YouTube channels you're subscribed to by categories.
Easily share your favorite channels with friends, and soon enjoy a detailed statistical data dashboard.

[Coming soon](https://my-tubes.com)

# Why I Built My-Tubes:

I found it very hard to find specific channels that I follow, as YouTube isn't designed for hardcore users.
Additionally, when friends ask me to share YouTube channels, I need to do this one by one.
With My-Tubes, I can organize everything very easily using drag and drop.
